# DS Coin


### Concepts used in the implementation - 
1. Merkle Tree
2. Hashing 
3. Blockchains
4. Mining
5. Various others algorithms and data structures 

### How to test run
You need to have JAVA11 installed in your system, where you want to test it. Compile using the *makefile*. Then to know about functions to create instances of admin, moderator, and members, we may refer to [DriverCode.java](https://github.com/Mukulguptaiit/DSCoin/blob/main/DSCoinPackage/DriverCode.java). We can also find the example use cases of functions to initialize and send coins there.
